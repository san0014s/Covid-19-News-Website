            COVID-19, also known as coronavirus, is a respitory illness caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. Symptoms

        <p style="font-family: Charcoal, sans-serif; margin-top: 20px; text-align: left; margin-left: 100px; width:60%">
            The virus is spread mainly through respitory droplets, which means you can become infected when in close
            contact with others.
            It is also possible to contract COVID-19 through contact with an infected surface (such as a table, door
            knob, or other commonly touched areas).
