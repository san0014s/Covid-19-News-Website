# Central Coronavirus Information Platform (C.C.I.P.)

## Our Mission
We are committed to the idea of creating a website that covers the coronavirus pandemic. We've guided our progress and development with these key concepts:
  - Keeping the general public informed on a national and local level.
  - Many people do not know what website to trust or whether the information they are given is true/credible. This is an opportunity for us to correct that. 
  - We want to provide a source of factual information and news that can be accessible to everyone.
  - Have the information accessible to everyone and whenever needed.
